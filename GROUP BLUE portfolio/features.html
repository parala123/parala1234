			<p>Riding can also improve your neck strength. For some, this may not seem like a big deal, but for others with back problems or neck problems, it’s almost like a therapy to the neck and back. Make sure your bike is fitted and adjusted to fit you correctly. Craning or straining your neck will do the opposite and you don’t want to do any damage to your body. It can also help strengthen your knees and thighs. Individuals with knee or thigh issues will find riding a motorcycle is a kind of physical therapy. It requires you use your knees and thighs, but without straining them too much. Over time, you’ll build muscle while eliminating any pains.
